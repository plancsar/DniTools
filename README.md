# DniTools
A collection of tools for the D'ni language created by Richard A. Watson at Cyan Inc.

**dnitime.py** prints the current D'ni date and time, as described in the Myst Online: Uru Live game.

**dninum.py** converts numbers between base 10 and 25, with various formats (Dnifont, Alphanumeric, Brackets).

**dniroman.py** converts a line of text in D'ni to and from various transliterations.

**dnisort.py** sorts a csv database of D'ni words (or any wordlist for that matter) in D'ni alphabetical order, using NTS or Dnifont encoding (OTS is too irregular to sort properly).

**dnitransl.py** is a (bad) attempt at a rough D'ni-to-English automated translator.

**podportals.py** is a predictor for the Pod ages and for Eder Gira sunrise/sunset.

**agm_dates.sh** prints a list of D'ni dates for the All Guild Meetings for the current (or a given) year, to be used by the AGM moderator.
