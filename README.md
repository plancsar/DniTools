# DniTools
A collection of tools for the D'ni language, created by Richard A. Watson at Cyan Inc.

DniTime prints the current D'ni date and time, as described in the Myst Online: Uru Live game.

DniNum converts numbers between base 10 and 25, with various formats (Dnifont, Alphanumeric, Brackets).

DniRoman converts a line of text in D'ni to and from various transliterations.

DniSort sorts a csv database of D'ni words (or any wordlist for that matter) in D'ni alphabetical order, using NTS or Dnifont encoding (OTS is too irregular to sort properly).

DniTransl is an attempt at a rough D'ni-to-English automated translator.
