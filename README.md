# DniTools
A collection of tools for the D'ni language, created by Richard A. Watson at Cyan Worlds

DniTime prints the current D'ni date in extended format, and the pahrtahvo as it appears on the clock in the Neighborhoods in the Myst Online: Uru Live game.

DniNum converts numbers between base 10 and 25, with various formats (Dnifont, Alphanumeric, Brackets).

DniSort sorts a csv database of D'ni words (or any wordlist for that matter) in D'ni alphabetical order, using NTS or Dnifont encoding (OTS is too irregular to sort properly).
